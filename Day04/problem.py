Problem: Merge Two Sorted Arrays

You are given two sorted arrays arr1 of size m and arr2 of size n. 
Your task is to merge these two arrays into a single sorted array 
without using any extra space (i.e., in-place merging). 

The elements in arr1 should be merged first, followed by the elements of arr2, 
resulting in both arrays being sorted after the merge.

Example:
Input: arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7], arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
Output: arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
