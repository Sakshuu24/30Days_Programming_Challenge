Problem: Find All Subarrays with Zero Sum

You are given an integer array `arr` of size `n`. 
Your task is to find all the subarrays whose elements sum up to zero. 

A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array.

Input:
- An integer array arr of size n where n represents the number of elements in the array.

Output:
- Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers:
  1. The starting index (0-based) of the subarray.
  2. The ending index (0-based) of the subarray.
- If no such subarrays are found, return an empty list.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, -3, 3, -1, 2]
Output: [(0, 2), (1, 3)]
